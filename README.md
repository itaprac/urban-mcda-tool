# Urban MCDA Tool

This is a minimal prototype of a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis tool for selecting points on a map.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

CSV files with points and criteria are saved to the `data` directory.
